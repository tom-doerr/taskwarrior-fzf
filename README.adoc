== Taskwarrior fzf interface

An https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] based UI for
https://taskwarrior.org/[taskwarrior], implemented as a `/bin/sh`
script.

=== Install

1. Link / Copy / Move the file `taskfzf` from this repo to your `$PATH`.
2. Make sure you have https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases[fzf 0.19.0 or
   newer] installed.

=== Usage

==== Command Line Arguments

Launching `taskfzf`, will present you an `fzf` interface where every
task is a line you can filter out using `fzf`’s magical search.

Without arguments, you’ll see the list of tasks `task` would list if
given no arguments.

You can supply a ``report'' argument (e.g `ls`, `list`, `next`..) to
`taskfzf` as you’d supply `task`.

Besides that, `taskfzf` also accepts modifications to your config using
`rc.` arguments given right before the optional report argument.

==== Key Bindings

`taskfzf` uses https://www.mankier.com/1/fzf#Key_Bindings[`fzf`’s
bindings] to perform actions over the highlighted task or to change the
list of tasks presented. Since tasks are usually written in lower case
letters, and in order to mitigate key bindings clashes with a parent
program `taskfzf` may run inside (e.g tmux, Neovim’s `:term` etc.), I
decided to bind every upper case letter to an action.

Pressing `?` prints a summary of all key bindings and their actions but
the lists here explain a bit more.

===== Perform an action over the selected tasks

* `D` marks the tasks as done (`task do`).
* `X` Deletes the tasks (`task del`).
* `U` undo the last action performed (`task undo`).
* `E` edits the task in your editor (`task edit`).
* `A` appends a text to the tasks using a shell input (`task append`).
* `N` annotates a text to a task using a shell input (`task annotate`).
* `M` modifies a task using a shell input (`task modify`).
* `S` starts the tasks (`task start`).
* `P` stops the tasks (`task stop`).

IMPORTANT: The script expects all reports to put in their 1st
column the task’s number. You will get a warning when trying to perform
actions upon a certain task if that’s not the case. Adjust your reports
accordingly!

===== Change the current list of tasks

Each of the following key bindings changes the list of tasks you can
perform an actions upon. `taskfzf` does so by reprinting the list of
tasks with a different context (`rc.context`) or with a different
``report''.

_Choosing_ a different context/report is also performed by `fzf`.
`task reports` or `task contexts` supply the list of candidates.

In the tasks view, you can prompt for a different report / context
using:

* `R` changes the current ``report'' (`task reports`).
* `C` changes the current context (`task contexts`).
